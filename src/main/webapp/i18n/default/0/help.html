		<p>Start with 25 moves.</p>
		<p>The objective is to complete juice orders by swapping fruit types to match them. One move is equal to one swap. 
		When 3 or more fruits of the same type are matched in a row or column, they are cleared from the screen.</p>
		<p>Juice orders for each fruit type are shown on the screen. Fruits that are matched and cleared from the screen are collected in each fruit type’s juice order. For every 8, 25, and 40 fruits collected of one fruit type, a juice glass is awarded for a maximum of 3 juice glasses per fruit type. No additional juice glasses are awarded if more than 40 of a given fruit type are collected.</p>
		<p>A minimum of 5 juice glasses are awarded per game, with a maximum of 18. Each juice glass provides an additional pick in the bonus game.</p> 
		<p>Once all 25 moves are completed, the bonus game starts. Reveal the filled juice glasses in the bonus game and match 3 prizes to win. 
		If a purple instant win prize is revealed, the prize amount displayed is awarded instantly.</p>
